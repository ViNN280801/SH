The owner said:

- Where did you get this beautiful marble?

- Don't you recognize it?  Michelangelo said.

"This is the ugly stone that's been waiting in front of your store for twelve years.

When life seems difficult, realize that the universe just loves you too much to leave you alone. She cannot allow you to remain as you are now, because you are destined to be someone much bigger.
